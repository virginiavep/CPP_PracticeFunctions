# CPP_PracticeFunctions
CPP programs that perform small functions
Created for intro to operating systems and networking at UNCC
Distance.cpp calculates the distance between 2 user-given points
IntSwap.cpp swaps 2 user-given ints
PrintAndSortData.cpp puts 10 user-given ints into an array and prints the data in the reserve order. It then sorts them from smallest to largest and prints the result.
